GeoNode is a geospatial content management system, a platform for the management and publication of geospatial data.

Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation of data, metadata, and map visualization. Each dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users. .

It is also designed to be a flexible platform that software developers can extend, modify or integrate against to meet requirements in their own applications.
